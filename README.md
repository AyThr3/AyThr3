Since I don't really know what I'm doing yet, please enjoy this recipe for lemonade concentrate. You seriously won't believe how good it tastes.

### :lemon: Tools :lemon:

- Vegetable peeler, or microplane
- Knife
- Lemon reamer, or other kind of juicer (or your bare hands)
- Stove pot
- A bowl
- Measuring cups
- Sieve
- A pitcher (or other large container to hold the finished lemonade

### :lemon: Ingredients :lemon:

- Approximately 10 small lemons
- About 1.25 US cups of granulated or cane sugar[^1]
- About 0.75 US cups water[^1]

[^1]: For those who may not use cups, don't feel the need to convert your units. What's important is the ratio of ingredients. The correct ratio is 1 part lemon juice : 0.8 parts sugar : 0.5 parts water

### :lemon: Steps :lemon:

1. Use the peeler to zest 1 or 2 of the lemons. Put the zest in the bowl.
2. Juice lemons until you have a little over 1.5 US cups of lemon juice. Pour juice into the pitcher and set aside.
3. Put the sugar into the zest bowl. Roughly mix and mash the sugar-zest around for a while.
4. Put the sugar-zest mixture into the pot along with the water. Turn on the stove, stirring to prevent burning. Let it come to a boil, then wait for about 2 minutes. All the sugar should dissolve.
5. Turn off stove and remove pot from heat. Let it cool.
6. Strain the sugary-zesty mixture through the sieve, and into the pitcher.

### :lemon: Serving :lemon:

This is lemonade concentrate. When you want a drink, combine 1 part concentrate with 1 part water, and fine-tune to your liking. Enjoy!
